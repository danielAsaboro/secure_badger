# Security Deep Dive — Video Series

<Note>
**Video content is in production.** Comprehensive video scripts covering all 6 vulnerabilities and the framework comparison are complete. Recording is in progress.
</Note>

## Planned Topics

Each video walks through the vulnerable code, demonstrates the exploit, and implements the fix in both Anchor and Pinocchio.

| Video | Duration (est.) | Focus |
|-------|----------------|-------|
| Missing Signer Checks | 8 min | Unauthorized ownership transfer via missing signature validation |
| Missing Owner Checks | 7 min | Fake account injection via missing program ownership validation |
| Type Cosplay | 7 min | Privilege escalation via account type confusion |
| Arbitrary CPI | 9 min | Authority hijacking via unvalidated cross-program invocations |
| PDA Sharing | 6 min | Cross-user fund theft via insufficient PDA seed derivation |
| Reinitialization Attacks | 8 min | Account takeover via missing initialization guards |
| Anchor vs Pinocchio | 12 min | Side-by-side security comparison across all vulnerabilities |

## Main Course (25-30 minutes)

A single comprehensive video covering:

- The Solana account model and why these vulnerabilities exist
- Live demonstrations of 2-3 critical exploits
- Fixes in both Anchor and Pinocchio
- Security best practices checklist
- When to use each framework

## Learning Path Recommendations

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Beginners">
    1. Watch the Main Course video first (complete overview)
    2. Missing Signer Checks (most common vulnerability)
    3. Missing Owner Checks (second most common)
    4. Framework Comparison (understand tooling choices)
    5. Remaining vulnerabilities as needed
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Intermediate">
    1. Individual vulnerability videos for knowledge gaps
    2. Framework Comparison (optimize your tooling choice)
    3. Main Course as a comprehensive review
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Advanced">
    1. Framework Comparison for optimization insights
    2. Individual videos as reference material
    3. Use the test suite as templates for your own protocols
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## In the Meantime

While videos are being produced, the written documentation covers everything:

- [Signer Checks](/vulnerabilities/signer-checks) — full walkthrough with code and exploit tests
- [Owner Checks](/vulnerabilities/owner-checks) — fake account attacks explained
- [Type Cosplay](/vulnerabilities/type-cosplay) — discriminator validation deep dive
- [Arbitrary CPI](/vulnerabilities/arbitrary-cpi) — CPI target validation
- [PDA Sharing](/vulnerabilities/pda-sharing) — PDA seed derivation patterns
- [Reinitialization Attacks](/vulnerabilities/reinitialization-attacks) — initialization guard patterns

Clone the repository and run `npm test` to see live exploits in your terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/danielAsaboro/solana_badger
cd solana_badger
npm install
npm test
```
